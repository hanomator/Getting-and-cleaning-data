### Introduction

In this repository i have stored the code for the programming assignment of the course "Getting and cleaning data".


### Data Set

In this assignment, we use the data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones".

Is has been taken from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).


### Execution and files

- The Data Set has been stored in the "UCI HAR Dataset/" directory.

- The script is named "run_analysis.R". It can be executed, using R or Rstudio without any parameters.

- The "CodeBook.md" describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

- The result of the execution is that a "tidy_data.txt" file is being created, that stores the data (mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity & subject) for later analysis.
